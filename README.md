# docker-stuff
Docker images and how to run them

## What?
Just containers I build and use. I like the idea of using Docker for everything, and like "everyone else" I was impressed by Jess Frazelle (https://github.com/jessfraz). Running everything in a container? Why not?  
So that is what I'm trying to do and learn, but with my own Dockerfiles so I actually learn what the heck it's all about.

## docker-on-x
I use `docker-on-x` to run GUI stuff. It's a simpel script that helps with running containers with a GUI. Read more over at: https://paddy-hack.gitlab.io/posts/running-dockerized-gui-applications/  
The actual script can be found over at https://gitlab.com/dotter/docker/blob/master/bin/docker-on-x  
`wget https://gitlab.com/dotter/docker/raw/master/bin/docker-on-x`
